Fortinet Technologies (Canada) Inc.
Software Development QA Engineer
Instructions for the Off-site Written Interview

November 2015


Introduction

The successful candidates for the open position of Software Development QA
Engineer will take on various tasks, including:

    - manual system-level product testing
    - setting up test environments
    - reproducing customer-reported issues
    - learning and understanding of various networking protocols
    - developing new automated test systems
    - maintaining existing automated test systems

These written interview questions focus on exploring the candidates knowledge of
scripting languages used for some of our automated test systems.

This is an open-book test. A list of resources is provided towards the end of
this document. You are encouraged to make good use of them. The on-site
interview will ask questions that allow each candidate the opportunity to
demonstrate their level of knowledge in the same area.


Structure of the Test Questions

This test places the candidate in a situation similar to what the team handles
regularly. The NIST organisation provides a data feed of publicly announced
software vulnerabilities on their website: https://nvd.nist.gov/download.cfm
The team is tasked with extracting this information on a regular basis.

An initial implementation is provided in Perl. You may review it and rewrite in
any other scripting language available on Microsoft Windows or Linux, such as
Python, Ruby, Tcl, etc.

Here is the directory structure used by the reference implementation:

    nvd
      |
      --- download # contains files downloaded from the internet for the task
      |
      --- lib      # Perl modules created for this task are saved here
      |
      --- log      # any log messages generated by the scripts may be saved here
      |
      --- scripts  # top level scripts for this task

A Perl module exists in the lib directory. It is used by the script in scripts
directory. One of the XML files provided by the NIST feed is saved into the
download directory.
      

Required Perl Modules

Perl is usually installed by default on regular Linux desktops. For Microsoft
Windows, ActiveState Perl is recommended: http://www.activestate.com/activeperl

The following Perl modules are used:

    - strict       # this is a standard Perl module. It is always installed.
    - warning      # same as strict, this is a standard Perl module
    - Dumpvalue    # Perl core module used for introspection
    - FindBin      # should also always be available if Perl is installed

    - XML::LibXML  # needs to be installed. Used to parse the NIST XML files.


Perl Documentation

Here are some useful Perl documents:

    - Perl programming landing page
      https://www.perl.org/

    - CPAN - Perl module pages
      http://search.cpan.org
      https://metacpan.org/

    - XML::LibXML tutorial
      http://search.cpan.org/~shlomif/XML-LibXML-2.0122/LibXML.pod
      https://metacpan.org/pod/distribution/XML-LibXML/LibXML.pod
      the Perl module is a wrapper around the C module: http://www.xmlsoft.org/

    - Dumpvalue manual page
      http://perldoc.perl.org/Dumpvalue.html

    - DBI
      http://dbi.perl.org/
      http://search.cpan.org/~timb/DBI-1.634/DBI.pm
      https://metacpan.org/pod/DBI

Perl provides module documentation as Perldoc. If the module is installed, the
documentation can be accessed using:

    perldoc <module_name>
    perldoc FindBin

where <module_name> is the name of the module. An example for FindBin is
provided.

The implementation provided in lib uses some not-so-common Perl data structures.
The following Perl documentation may be useful:

    - Perl references tutorials
      http://perldoc.perl.org/perlreftut.html
      http://perldoc.perl.org/perlref.html

    - Perl Object-Oriented Programming
      http://perldoc.perl.org/perlootut.html
      This is not required for this task. But may be useful for understanding
      how to use some of the external modules (XML::LibXML, Dumpvalue, DBI)

    - Perl debugging tutorial
      http://perldoc.perl.org/perldebtut.html
      Very helpful for debugging Perl scripts and modules. Otherwise, not
      required for this task.

    - Package
      https://perldoc.perl.org/functions/package.html

Most of the common Perl modules can be installed on Linux using yum, dnf or
apt-get. On Microsoft Windows, ppm installs most modules.


Relational Database Documentation

The team uses both MySQL and SQLite. Candidate may choose to use either. May
also use any other relational database.

MySQL documentation home is at: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/. An installation of
MySQL server will be useful for testing.

SQLite documentation is available at http://www.sqlite.org/. There is no need
for a database server. This is one advantage of SQLite over other relational
database systems.

The Perl DBI module is often used for database implementations from Perl scripts
and modules. It presents a consistent interface to Perl applications,
irrespective of the underlying relational database server. A tutorial is
available at: http://www.mysqltutorial.org/perl-mysql/
Other than the difference in how the connect() method is called, most of the
tutorial will apply to other database servers, such as SQLite or PostgreSQL.
The module documentation listed earlier is very detailed and useful.


Turning in your work

Place all work, downloaded files and logs in the working directory provided.
Retain the directory structure. Here is the suggested final directory layout:

    <candidate_name>
        |
        ---    nvd
           |
           --- download
           |
           --- lib
           |
           --- log
           |
           --- scripts

where <candidate_name> is the candidate's full name without spaces or special
characters. If you need any new directories, create them under nvd, at the same
level as lib and scripts.

It will be helpful to create Answers.txt under the nvd directory. You can
provide a short summary of your response to each of the items in Questions.txt.

When all is done, compress the top level directory: <candidate_name> with the
appropriate extension: .zip or .gz. Submit the compressed file back to Fortinet.
If you find that the compressed file is too large to send by e-mail, you may
upload it to a shared drive like Dropbox or Google Drive, and send information
on how to retrieve it. You may also remove the download and log directories from
the directory structure before compressing it and sending by e-mail. These two
are likely to be the largest directories by size.


Comments and Feedback

If you run into issues, create a plain text file in the top level directory of
your submission, at the same level as nvd, to explain how you addressed them.




Good luck!
